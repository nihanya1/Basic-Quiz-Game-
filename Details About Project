Game Introduction: The game starts with a welcome message and brief instructions.
Questions and Answers: Questions and answers are stored in a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains a "question" key and an "answer" key.
Main Loop: The game loops through each question, prompting the user for an answer, checking the answer, and providing feedback.
Score Tracking: A score variable is incremented for each correct answer.
End of Game: After all questions are answered, the final score is displayed. The player is then asked if they want to play again.
This basic structure can be expanded with additional features such as multiple-choice questions, timed responses, or a graphical user interface using libraries such as Tkinter.

Check Answers:

If the answer is correct, increment the score.
Provide feedback to the player (e.g., "Correct!" or "Incorrect, the right answer is...").
End of Game:

After all questions have been asked, display the player's total score.
Optionally, provide an option to play again or exit the game.
